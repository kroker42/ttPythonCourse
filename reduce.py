# reduce is an implementation of the mathematical concept 'fold' or 'reduction'.

# It is often used in functional programming.
# Functional programming uses a series of **pure functions** to work on **immutable data**.
# The functions do not rely on **internal state**.
# Functional programming favours **recursion** over e.g. loops.

# Python is a multi-paradigm language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming.
# The programming style is different from OOP and functional programming.
# The most important principle of The Pythonic Way is:
#
#           Simple is better than complex
#

# We will explore different ways of implementing reduce in python.

# Reduce uses another function to fold a collection of items together into a single, cumulative value.
# I.e. the input to reduce is another function and many items, and the output is a single item.

# In python, functions are **first-class objects**.

def reduce():
    return False
